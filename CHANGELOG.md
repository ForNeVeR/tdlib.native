Changelog
=========

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]
### Removed
- **(Breaking change!)** The package for Ubuntu 20.04 (OpenSSL v1.1) is no longer maintained nor updated (because [the corresponding GitHub runner is no longer available](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/11101)).

## [1.8.45] - 2025-02-14
### Changed
- We switched the builds for x86-64 macOS to macOS 13 image (from macOS 11).
- Update to [TDLib v1.8.45](https://github.com/tdlib/td/tree/721300bcb4d0f2114505712f4dc6350af1ce1a09).

## [1.8.29] - 2024-05-28
### Changed
- Update to [TDLib v1.8.29](https://github.com/tdlib/td/tree/fd3154b28727df9e66423d64168fab1202d8c849).

## [1.8.21.2] - 2024-05-27
### Fixed
- The main package **tdlib.native** now depends on the following platform packages:
  - **tdlib.native.linux-x64** (Ubuntu 22.04),
  - **tdlib.native.osx-arm64** (macOS AArch64),
  - **tdlib.native.osx-x64** (macOS x86-64),
  - **tdlib.native.win-x64** (Windows x86-64).

## [1.8.21.1] - 2024-05-26 [YANKED]
**Note** that this version has been unlisted from nuget.org because the main package **tdlib.native** was prepared incorrectly: its dependencies on the platform packages weren't set.

### Changed
- **(Breaking change!)** The main package is now built on Ubuntu 22.04 and requires OpenSSL v3. The package for Ubuntu 20.04 (the previous default) is now available separately as `tdlib.native.ubuntu-20.04-x64`.

  Consult the package documentation to see the current versions and layout.
- **(Breaking change!)** The platform-dependent artifacts have been extracted to separate packages. The main package no longer includes any executable files, and just depends on the latest versions of the platform-dependent packages. The new packages:
  - **tdlib.native.linux-x64** (Ubuntu 22.04),
  - **tdlib.native.ubuntu-20.04-x64** (Ubuntu 20.04),
  - **tdlib.native.osx-arm64** (macOS AArch64),
  - **tdlib.native.osx-x64** (macOS x86-64),
  - **tdlib.native.win-x64** (Windows x86-64).

  You may directly depend on them as needed.
- (Technically a _breaking change_, though it's not expected to actually break anything.) The Linux artifacts no longer include `.a` files.

### Added
- Support for AArch64 versions of macOS.
- Support for Ubuntu 22.04 (OpenSSL v3).

- **(Breaking change!)** The package now only supports macOS 11, since macOS 10 is out of support by the OS (and CI infrastructure) vendor.
- **(Breaking change!)** The package now only supports Ubuntu 20.04 and newer, since Ubuntu 18.04 has reached EOL.
